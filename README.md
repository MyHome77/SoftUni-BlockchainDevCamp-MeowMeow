# MeowMeow
**MeowMeow** is a DApp (Decentralized Application) implemented with Java and Solidity. The project keeps some data and logic in the Ethereum blockchain and provides an application to access it.

## General Requirements
- Smart contracts, implemented in Solidity, deployed in the Ropsten testnet
- Client-side - JSPs, JavaScript
- Decentralized Storage - IPFS
- Unit tests - Truffle
- Server-side logic - JavaEE, Tomcat, Web3j, IPFS
- Token - MEOW token

## Business Logic
- *Guests* can view the *organizations* and their *cats* listed for *adoption* 
- *Guests* can register as *users* and *adopt cats*
- *Users* register and list *cats* for *adoption* in the Ethereum blockchain
- *Users* should have a wallet
  
## Bonus 
- Create token
- People can use ETHs only to buy our token
- Make the token the main currency and accept only it
